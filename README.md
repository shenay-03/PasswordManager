I made a password manager for specifically my local machine which lets me access any passwords I have and search for any of my stored passwords. 
When you first open the website, you will be led to the home page with no passwords in it, but there are 2 buttons at the top. One of them is titled add/delete.
Upon being pressed, you will be prompted to put a location the words "add" or "delete" a username and a password. Upon entering those, you will see on the home page the changes 
(whether it be add or deleting). When you have a lot of passwords, there is a search bar that lets you look for a certain location by typing its name.
